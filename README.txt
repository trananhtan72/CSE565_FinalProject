Remember the input to main.pu should be a .graph file and the output should be a .out file. 

Your script should run with the following format : 

    python3 main.py student_test_cases/NAME.graph

The output file must have the same name as the input file, i.e., for a NAME.graph input file, the output file should be NAME.out.

There must also be a corresponding NAME.truth file in the student_test_cases directory. If there is no corresponding .truth file, the test case will be scored as zero.

If you change any of the directory names, please update the makefile accordingly. Only change the names that you are allowed to change in the makefile!!

Directories:
- student-test-cases : Directory containing your .graph and .truth files.
- student-test-outputs : Directory to store .out files temporarily before scoring. DO NOT SAVE FILES TO THIS DIRECTORY MANUALLY.
- makefile : The makefile to run and score your tests.
- test-instances: Directory containing common test cases (do not modify).
- outputs: Directory to store .out files generated by your script.

Makefile Targets:
- make run : Runs 'make clean' and then your main.py script on all .graph files in student-test-cases and test-instances directories.
           
           !!! main.py should generate .out files in the outputs directory. !!!!
           
- make score : Runs 'make run' and scores the generated .out files against the corresponding .truth files and provides a score. Only for instructor use.
- make clean : Cleans up all generated .out files from the outputs directory.
- make all : Runs 'make score'.
